# Base Streamer
Streams multiple rover cameras at the base station

## Notes:
- CMakeLists.txt may contain explicitly stated file paths (Could pose issues if libraries are stored elsewhere)
- Base64 conversion uses outside libraries (https://renenyffenegger.ch/notes/development/Base64/Encoding-and-decoding-base-64-with-cpp/)
- Boost Async Websocket Reference (https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/libs/beast/example/websocket/server/async/websocket_server_async.cpp)
